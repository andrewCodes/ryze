# Ryze trial - Nudge Clone

__Brief:__
We're looking for you to build a portion (at least the header + the first 2-3 sections) of this design as a static template then provide us with the HTML and other working files to review.

__A few quick points:__
- Ideally use scss for styling. Please don't use a CSS framework (i.e. bootstrap).
- Although not required, feel free to add JavaScript.
- You don't need to integrate any forms.

__Deliverables:__
- HTML template built responsively down to mobile based on the desktop design.
- Assets/working files.

A PDF mockup for the site can be found in img>mockup

## General info
This website is a collection of simple tips and guidelines to help web developers improve their design skills.
	
## Technologies
Project is created with:
* HTML
* Sass (SCSS)
* CSS Grid
* Flexbox
* BEM (Block Element Modifier methodology)
* JavaScript
	
## Setup
To run this project locally, clone this repo and use npm:

```
$ npm install
$ npm run start
```

Please check `package.json` for useful scripts.

## Branching
I only have one master branch, "__master__". __Master__ only ever contains deployable code. As development work takes place (for example adding a new section) this always happens on a separate branch taken from the most recent commit point on __master__. When work on a branch is complete and tested, the commits on that branch are merged back into __master__ and the development branch is deleted.

Only complete and tested work is merged into __main__.

Each development branch will have a precise and limited scope (a new section for example).

## Website Content

Upon completion the site will contain...

* Header including responsive burger menu
* Hero section
* Sign up form
* Ethos & Values
* Who we help
* How do we do it
* Why it works
* Footer

## Future Development

This project is still under construction.
